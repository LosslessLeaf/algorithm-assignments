Starting with a random card from a deck, choose whether you believe
the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the current card.
Guess correctly (by entering either "high" or "low") and your score 
will increase by one point. Quit at any time using "quit".

I would like to get criticism on my code structure and whether I am
looking at things in an object-oriented way. Are there features
that are unnecessary or maybe should be merged together? If so, why?
