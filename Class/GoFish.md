GoFish algorithm takes the old card game into a 
new programming aspect. The player gets 7 cards
and scores based on the amount of pairs they are
able to make. If a player makes a pair, they draw
cards until they have 7 cards back in their hand.
The game is played until the deck has been completely
dealt out.

State of the project:

The game is currently unplayable. I was in the middle
of creating player hands and getting the WinCondition
for a while loop to keep the game going.

I would like any input other than restructuring of classes
into files, as that will be my next step.
